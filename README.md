2-11-14 class for histogram equalization

We want to connect a lot of clients to the main server,
which will spawn different servers running on different
nodes. Each node is a consumer to the main server, and
processes an image. Then the node becomes a producer and
sends its result to the main server (now the consumer),
which sends the result back to the client.
